# Bet Gaming (WIP)

### Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I choose CRA because it's a consolidated boilerplate with a lot of ready made configs and optimizations for webpack, babel, the development and the build process at all.

I'm using the generated project to work on the two edges:

- **Front** (in ./src and ./public folders);
- **Back** (in ./back_src folder with server.js as entrypoint);

---

### Questions

1. Write a function that connects to https://restcountries.eu/ and gets a unique country from a
   specific name given using the Node back end and send it to the front end.

-- the backend function is **back_src/controllers/CountryController.getByName** and **getByCode**;
-- I writed the flow from front (redux) to back (express);
-- the redux flow files are in **src/domains/country/actions**: **fetchCountryByName** and **fetchCountryByCode**;
-- it uses the fetchMiddleware to dispatch calls to backend;

2. Using the same API ( https://restcountries.eu/ ), and from an array of string, write a function
   that returns a list of countries where their name matches at least a part of one of these string
   use the Node back end and send it to the front end.

-- the backend function is **back_src/controllers/CountryController.getByNames**;
-- it receive an array in url first;second;third, url: /api/countries/by-names/brazil;malta;
-- in front it uses the same api in component **src/domains/country/CountrySelect**;
-- in the country table, the same way of search, by ; character, are enabled;
-- the country table search match against code, name, region and subregion;

3. Using the same API ( https://restcountries.eu/ ) in the React front end list all the countries
   and a field to filter the country by name.

-- the backend function is **back_src/controllers/CountryController.getAllAndReturn**;
-- the front flow starts in **src/domains/country/CountryTable**;
-- the front filter does not dispatch a server call;

4. Using the Slot Machine data, create a function that, when itâ€™s called by the front end, gives back the
   result of a spin and show the result.

-- the slot machine component is **src/domains/game/SlotMachineCard**;
-- the three reels are **src/domains/game/SlotMachineReel**;
-- some logic is in Card, some in Reel;
-- all the feature of slot machine are front only, because there are no persistence in backend;
-- **(WIP) extract the logic to a pure .js file to write some tests with jest**;

---

### Development

- Start the servers using the **"npm start-dev"** or **"yarn start-dev"**:
  -- front run into **[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**;
  -- back run into **[localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)**;

In development, I use npm-run-all to start both servers (a back/express server and a front/webpack-dev-server from CRA).

The sass layer is builded using node-sass-chokidar, and all .sass files turns into .css files that can be imported into components.

_The CRA project does not use CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS approach, only the .css import into .js files facility._

### Build & Deploy

When we build with "npm/yarn build" command, a build folder is generated.
In production, we only use the ./back_src, ./build and ./server.js files (plus .env and pkg.json).

The integration has configured in heroku, and the link is:

### FRONT:

##### Code Standard

- I'm using prettier to format the code in a pre-commit hook;
- The front code is structured as:
  -- **index.js** (as entrypoint file);
  -- **App** (entrypoint component);
  -- **styles** (general style .sass files);
  -- **configs** (common config to use across the system);
  -- **domains** (domain driven folder to create components);
  -- **middlewares** (folder to store redux middlewares like fetch, logger, analytics);

The Domain folder contains all components separated by application higher domains and/or features, and each domain can have:

- **Selectors** (reselect files to write performatic memoized functions);
- **Constants** (specific constants of domain);
- **Components/Containers** (dumb and smart at same file, better to read/code);
- **Styles** (specific styles with same name as component);
- **Reducer and Actions** (single file action/reducer approach, better to code entire flow of redux without need to navigate);

### BACK:

##### Code Standard

- Prettier to code format too;
- The back code is structured as:
  -- **server.js** (as entrypoint file);
  -- **./back_src/configs** (simple and unique configurations folder);
  -- **./back_src/controllers** (controllers of a MVC structure as ES6 classes);
  -- **./back_src/services** (layer to store ES6 classes with common/shared funcionalities);
